I made a template for a simple, professional project page for academic research papers. See a live demo of the template [here](https://research-template.roman.technology/) and the code and usage instructions [here](https://github.com/romanhauksson/academic-project-astro-template).

## features

- Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for fast and optimized static site generation and support for adding custom components from UI frameworks like React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, SolidJS, AlpineJS and Lit
- Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first, responsive design
- Edit the template in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows you to write content in Markdown and use JSX variables, expressions, and components
- Custom components for figures, videos, YouTube embeds, two-column sections, and LaTeX equations
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks using [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/)
- Fully responsive layout that looks great on all devices
