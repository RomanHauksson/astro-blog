I was involved in a startup called "I" that aimed to enable people to sell a percentage of their future income as shares to investors by securitizing [income share agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement). Learn more about the idea [here](https://iatskar.notion.site/I-870faf6130c4483c8c615f7214ccf75d).

The startup didn't end up going anywhere, but while we were working on it, I made a demo to visualize what the platform might have looked like. It allows you to browse people's profiles and submit buy or sell orders, and if a matching order is found, it executes the trade using a [continuous double auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_auction).
