I made a website template and component library to help researchers build project pages for their papers, based on the design from the original [Nerfies page](https://nerfies.github.io/). Instead of manually editing an HTML file, they can author the page's content in Markdown, then deploy it with GitHub Pages. [See a live demo of the template](https://research-template.roman.technology). Used by hundreds of teams.

## features

- Pre-built components for LaTeX, figures, tables, code blocks (with syntax highlighting), videos, YouTube embeds, 3D objects, comparison sliders, carousels, tabbed slides, and pairs of columns.
- Optional dark mode :)
- Automatically converts figures stored as PDF files into images.
- Compresses images using [AVIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF) and uses [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images) to minimize loading time.
- Optimized font rendering, with [resized fallback font faces](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/font-fallbacks) to prevent cumulative layout shift.
- Responsive, accessible, and SEO-optimized.
- Add your own components with HTML or any Javascript framework you like. React comes pre-configured, but you could also use Vue, Svelte, etc.
- Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
