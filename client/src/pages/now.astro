        In my 4th year studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at
        Dallas. Taking the following courses:
        <ul>
          <li>Data Structures and Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis</li>
          <li>Software Engineering</li>
          <li>Systems Programming in UNIX and Other Environments</li>
          <li>Programming Language Paradigms</li>
          <li>Neurobioinformatics</li>
          <li>
            Professional Responsibility in Computer Science and Software
            Engineering
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Working as a frontend engineer at Baby Steps, a startup that helps
        prospective patients decide which IVF clinic to choose using a birth
        rate prediction model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Figuring out what to do this summer. Looking for software engineering or
        research positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Considering the following project ideas. If you're interested in
        collaborating with me on any of them, please reach out or book a call
        with me!
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b
              >A benchmark that uses a simulated attack–defense-style CTF to
              test how good LLMs are at red teaming and blue teaming.</b
            > This could be used to track the offense-defense balance of LLM-assisted
            cybersecurity over time, and this style of benchmark (like <a
              href="/projects/gamebench">GameBench</a
            >) is less susceptible to saturation because it's comparative: it
            grades each model using something like an Elo score, so it can
            retain precision well above superhuman performance as long as you
            have another model that can compete against it. I'm hesitant about
            this project because capability researchers might use it as a
            feedback signal to improve LLMs' hacking abilities.

            <b>A startup selling services to autonomous AI agents themselves.</b
            > I think agents will become an increasingly large part of the economy
            and eventually eclipse human economic activity. This is a totally new
            customer base. What services will they want to buy that current companies
            – who only focus on their human audience – can't provide? I think this
            is a promising idea, but executing it well would probably accelerate
            AI progress, decreasing the chance that society makes the post-superintelligence
            transition wisely. I think someone else will also attempt this anyway,
            so maybe i could counterfactually donate more of the profits to AI safety
            research than my competitors would or use the company's position as a
            lever to influence the development and deployment of AI agents for good?

              which people can learn.</b

            <a href="https://mathacademy.com/">Math Academy</a> is software that
            uses algorithms based on the science of learning to help students learn
            and retain math as efficiently as possible. What if we could bring the
            same efficiency in learning to any arbitrary subject? My vision is something
            akin to an LLM-based tutor chatbot with a model of all of the things
            you know and how they relate to each other, who challenges you to recall
            and explain concepts you've learned in previous study sessions based
            on a spaced repetition scheduler. How this would fit into my life goal
            of making AI go well i haven't figured out yet. Something something differentially
            accelerating human cognition.
