      I'm currently a 4th-year student studying Computer Science at the
      University of Texas at Dallas and a frontend engineer at an early-stage
      startup building a website to help prospective patients decide which IVF
      clinic to go to.

      I'm involved with <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"
        >Effective Altruism</a
      >, a community dedicated to thinking deeply about which world problems are
      the most important compared to the amount of resources dedicated to them,
      and the most effective ways to solve them. I'm dedicating my career to
      helping make sure the development of advanced artificial intelligence goes
      well for society: specifically,
      <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/"
        >reducing the risk that a rogue AI agent ends humanity</a
      > and <a
        href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-sentience/"
        >making sure that AI agents themselves don't suffer</a
      >.
