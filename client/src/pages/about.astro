      I'm currently a 3rd-year student studying Computer Science at the
      University of Texas at Dallas and a frontend engineer at an early-stage
      healthcare startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm involved with <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"
        >Effective Altruism</a
      >, a community dedicated to thinking deeply about which world problems are
      most important compared to the amount of resources dedicated to them, and
      the most effective ways to solve them. This has motivated me to dedicate
      my career to helping make sure the development of advanced artificial
      intelligence goes well for society: specifically,
      <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/"
        >reducing potential existential risks from AI</a
      > and <a
        href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-sentience/"
        >making sure that AI agents themselves don't suffer</a
      >.
