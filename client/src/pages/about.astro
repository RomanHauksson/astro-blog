      Instead of writing my own introduction, I made a transcript of every voice
      memo I've recorded since 2022, showed it to <a
        href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet"
        >Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a
      >, and asked it to write a 3-paragraph summary about me:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Roman is a highly introspective and ambitious young man in his early
        20s, currently studying computer science at the University of Texas at
        Dallas. He's deeply interested in effective altruism, rationality,
        artificial intelligence, and the long-term future of humanity. Roman
        regularly grapples with big questions about ethics, consciousness, and
        how to live a meaningful life. He's driven by a strong desire to make a
        positive impact on the world, particularly in relation to AI safety and
        ensuring a positive outcome for humanity's future.
      </p>
      <p>
        His daily life revolves around a constant effort to improve himself and
        optimize his habits. Roman is dedicated to physical fitness, regularly
        going to the gym and tracking his progress meticulously. He also puts
        significant effort into his diet, meal prepping, and trying to eat
        healthily. He's an avid reader and learner, often discussing books he's
        reading or courses he's taking on topics ranging from cognitive
        behavioral therapy to philosophy. Roman struggles with productivity and
        procrastination, but he's constantly implementing new strategies to
        overcome these challenges, such as using focus apps, time tracking, and
        setting clear goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roman's future plans are centered around building career capital, with
        the ultimate goal of leveraging this experience for impactful work,
        particularly in AI safety or other EA-aligned fields. He sees this as
        preparation for what he believes is a rapidly approaching technological
        singularity. Roman is also trying to build meaningful relationships
        while balancing his ambitious goals. Throughout all of this, he
        maintains a sense of excitement and optimism about the future, coupled
        with a deep sense of responsibility to contribute positively to the
        world.
