This is the repository for my blog and personal website. It was initialized using [Astro's official blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/), but i wrote all of the components from scratch, except a couple. You can visit it at [roman.computer](https://roman.computer) or [roman.technology](https://roman.technology).
